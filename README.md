# gravity-forms-view-entries
Allows viewing Gravity Forms entries on your site using shortcodes. Uses [gf-view-entries] shortcode.

Note: This plugin is no longer in active development by me, the plugin creator. I am now using the premium plugin GravityView for my needs. If anyone want to take over ownership and development of this plugin, let me know.
